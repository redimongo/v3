v3

* UPDATED 09-07-2014

Orginal work of: Russell Harrower

v3 is the first public release of RediMongo - designed and coded using open source code RediMongo is a blog/website software that users are able to use with MongoDB

This script has been a work in progress from the v1 first version which was designed for a Telco company and v2 which was designed for a radio station.

v3 will is all newly coded and as you will be able to see is coded from scratch all features as of 09-07-2014 (09-Aug-2014) not working. 

* The main template is coded for russellharrower.com and I personally will be using v3 for my blog.
